## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node

## Optimizations: 
As I continue to work on this project, I'd like to add the ability to see a weekly and a monthly view and I'd like the admin to be able to go back to older dates to see previous schedules

## Lessons Learned: 
I learned a lot of different ways to target specific parts of database collections and how to utilize them creatively to run a few of my functions.
